                The Persian cat, also known as the Persian Longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterised by a round face and short muzzle. 
                The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however, this has not been proven. 
                Instead, there is stronger evidence for a longhaired cat breed being exported from Afghanistan and Iran from the 19th century onwards.
                [1][2][3] Widely recognised by the North-West European cat fancy since the 19th century,[4] and after World War II by breeders from North America, Australia and New Zealand. 
                Some cat fancier organisations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others generally treat them as separate breeds.
